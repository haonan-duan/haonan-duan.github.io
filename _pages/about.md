<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a senior researcher at SenseTime Research, under the guidance of [Jifeng Dai](https://jifengdai.org/) and [Lewei Lu](https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?user=zdgKJXIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), specializing in Multimodal Large Language Models, Embodied AI, and Robot Learning. I collaborate closely with [Xizhou Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=02RXI00AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Hao Tian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=GNfC6yYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). My research interests include designing foundational models for robotics perception and manipulation. 

I received my Ph.D. in Control Theory and Control Engineering from Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2024, where I was advised by Prof. [Peng Wang](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~wangpengcasia). My research primarily focused on robot dexterous grasping and human-robot interaction. I had the privilege of collaborating closely with [Yiming Li](https://yimingli1998.github.io/) and [Wei Wei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7jZcTtUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra) on various projects in these areas.
